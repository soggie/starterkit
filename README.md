# Starter Kit

The starter kit I use for all my frontend projects. I may expand this to be able to scaffold different kinds of other projects instead.

## Commands

* `yarn dev` - runs the dev server
* `yarn build` - builds for production, Netlify deployment targeted
* `yarn preview` - previews production build
